# Stadium Panels

This section will teach how to combine the power of Revit API and Design Automation to generate conceptual design using Adaptive Components and Family Parameters. Adaptive components are PointElement based families, that allow you to parametrize your families with Adaptive Point elements. Like Family Instance parameters, Adaptive point elements can be modified at the Family instance level to generate flexible geometry and reuse family definition.

It is often tough to visualize the design upfront. Design automation for Revit offers a platform to automate generation of large number conceptual design files, and then see them all in a browser before deciding to chose one or tweak it further. In this section, I shall use the beauty in randomness to select a panel family and randomly vary its instance parameter to generate a complicated and beautiful structure. It is fascinating to see, how we start from so little: 2 family files, less than 200 lines of code and end up with a complicated and yet beautiful structure.
