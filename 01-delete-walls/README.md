# Delete Walls

This is one of our basic code samples, an “Hello World” application. In this section we will visit details about activity definition to see how to build an application that takes a Revit file as input to modify it and upload it to a cloud location. This section will cover details like command line inputs that run on cloud machine and variable expansion it uses internally. It will show how to setup a relationship between your appbundle and activity definition, wrt filenames that design automation service is expected to download and upload to.

We shall use basic input data sets to understand the workflow. The data sets and source code is provided in the additional materials section. Delete walls sample is used in many of our Forge tutorials including Postman collections and language neutral documentation such as curl based REST API documentation.
