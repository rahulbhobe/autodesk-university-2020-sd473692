# Grid Object Placement

In this section, I will show how to use Genetic Algorithm to generate multiple DWG files and upload them to BIM 360 as a single zipped file. A stepped or rectangular grid pattern will be created using parameteric constraints as inputs for minimum and maximum distance between furniture families. 

In an iterative process each “generation” will export and save its best fit layout DWG that has created most number of furniture instances using the given constraints. A full end to end working sample that integrates with BIM 360 will be shared for you to extend upon.
