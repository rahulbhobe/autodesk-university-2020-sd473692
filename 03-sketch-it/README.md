# Sketch It

Sketch It application was one of the early simple to understand end to end web application. This application allows a user to draw walls and floors on a web browser and generate Revit file with walls and floors corresponding to the lines drawn on the browser. This application, behind the scenes sends the corrdinate locations of points/lines drawn on the browser to Design Automation, and generate viewables so the user can view the results on the browser.

In this class we shall learn and understand how to implement Design Automation activity, appbundle and workitem necessary to build this application. While building on what we learnt about json serialization in previous section, this section will cover more complicated and large json input workflows. Unlike previous sections this section covers a Revit file creation workflow, since there is no input file to start with in this example.
